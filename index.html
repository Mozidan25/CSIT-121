            <h2>Lab 02 Reflection</h2>
            <p>in this lab, I learned how to use HTML to create a basic website. I practiced creating material with headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
             One problem I noticed was making sure that my GitHub Pages link worked correctly, which I solved by checking my file structure and settings.
            I also learned the importance of writing clean and correct code to avoid problems and make sure the website shows properly.  another significant was understanding how HTML structures a webpage, making it easy to read and navigate.
            this lab improved my confidence when creating HTML and putting a webpage online.</p>

            <h2>Lab 05 Reflection</h2>
            <p>In Lab 05, I used Flexbox and Media Queries to create a responsive layout. 
                I created internal navigation to help users browse between posts on the blog and ensure that the site looked well on both mobile and desktop devices. 
                This task helped me understand how to create websites that are simpler to use across devices.</p>
