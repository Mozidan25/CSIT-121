            <h2>Reflection What I Learned about CSS </h2>
            <p> This module taught me how to use CSS to style web pages. 
                I now know how to style particular elements using class and ID selectors, 
                including adjusting colors and spacing.  I had difficulty linking my CSS correctly, 
                but resolved it by reviewing my file structure.  I attempted with several colors and font styles to enhance readability.  
                This project demonstrated how CSS enhances a webpage's appearance and credibility.
